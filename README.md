This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Live demo [here](https://guess.f0lder.xyz/).

## Getting Started

First, you will need and API KEY from [RAWG](https://rawg.io/) then create a file `.env.local` and it should look like this:

```
KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
